- 🛠️ **Description**: This branch establishes the initial backend project structure with the following key components:  
  - Created `BackendApi.sln` solution targeting the .NET 9.0 framework.  
  - Organized project structure under `src/` (Api, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, Persistence) and `tests/` (unit test projects).  
  - Initialized core projects using `dotnet new` and linked them within the solution.  
  - Configured unit testing across all layers using xUnit.  
  - Integrated Scalar for API documentation, leveraging OpenAPI/Swagger standards.  
  - Enabled CORS to support seamless frontend integration.  
  - Defined project references to uphold clean architecture dependency rules.  
  - Implemented global exception handling with standardized DTOs for success/error responses and a custom exception base class.
